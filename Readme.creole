==About
[[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/zoom/|Please see the official BukkitDev page for more info.]]

==How to build
Just import the sources into your ide. In eclipse, place the source code into your workspace, then create a new project with the same name as the source code folder. Add bukkit (1.3+) to your build path, and everything should work!

==How to update the code
Make a pull request. No feature is too small, and no question is stupid :D
